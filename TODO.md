Things I mean to do.

FROMDONE
========

Things I did which I'm keeping around to admire.

* Remove the early releases that lard up the CPAN with data files I didn't mean to include. (Sorry.)
* Benchmark push, pop, shift, unshift to optimize the stack.
* Prune impossible branches -- branches that fail to touch a particular letter.
* Prune unnecessary branches -- branches that must be contained by those I plan to visit already.
